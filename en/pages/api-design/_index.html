This is a first draft of the API design. It currently reflects the structure of data as curated.
The related <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lexical-cloud/lexical-cloud-data">json data</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lexical-cloud/lexical-cloud-data-hugo">generator tools</a> are available on github.
These resources are the start of a data pipeline to feed the future API.
