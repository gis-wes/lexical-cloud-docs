In the context of the Lexical.cloud backend, \
facing the many architecture possibilities to serve applications,

we decided to build blueprints for several architectures \
and against using a single provider or design

to achieve examples of the alternatives that Lexical.cloud is intended to highlight \
and create a feedback loop to push forward the greater project, \
accepting the discovery process will take many iterations to produce viable solutions.
