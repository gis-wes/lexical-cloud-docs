In the context of the Lexical.cloud community data, \
facing the need to separate contributions to data and transformation,

we decided to link input and output as submodules on transformation repos  \
and against using a single repo for all transformations

to achieve separation between many future transformations \
and simplicity for contributors to the source data \
accepting some duplication in overhead between repos.
