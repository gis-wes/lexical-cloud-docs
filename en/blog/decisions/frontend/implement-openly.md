In the context of the Lexical.cloud frontend, \
facing the desire for contributions from the community,

we decided to keep artifacts and workflows accessible to all contributors  \
and against using a any workflows that required special access

to achieve full visibility of contributions for the community, \
accepting the licensing for the projects should also be open.
