In the context of the Lexical.cloud cloud catalog, \
facing what format to capture metadata in markdown frontmatter for Hugo,

we decided to store metadata in the frontmatter of markdown as YAML \
and against using JSON or TOML, which Hugo also supports,

to achieve a simple format for metadata curation \
and compatiblity with other static site generators, \
accepting that consistent whitespace will need enforcement.
