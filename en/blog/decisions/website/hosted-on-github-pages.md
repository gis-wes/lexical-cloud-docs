In the context of the Lexical.cloud website, \
facing the need to serve static content,

we decided to let Github Pages serve the content from the public repo \
and against using a service with server-side capabilities

to achieve no-cost hosting with an easy deployment workflow, \
accepting that server side capabilities must be hosted elsewhere.
