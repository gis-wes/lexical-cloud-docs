#### The Challenge

Cloud computing is a vast domain with offerings from many providers. 
  - Vernacular differs with each cloud provider
  - Product naming creates distinct vocabularies
  - Features distributed differently across products
  - Translation between clouds providers is an art

#### Our Mission

Cross-reference products and capabilities of many cloud providers. 
  - Categorize by domain
  - Sort product capabilities
  - Link features with terminology
